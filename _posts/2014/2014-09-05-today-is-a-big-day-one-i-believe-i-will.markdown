Today is a big day. One I believe I will frequently look back to over the course of my life.





It is my last day at Choose Chicago. Choose Chicago's significance in the course of my life runs deep. Years ago my life was at a crossroads. I had decided to abandon pursuing music as my career and after much debate enrolled in college. 4 years and 3 children later I graduated and began looking for work in the IT field. However, my search quickly became defeating and frustrating as I searched for someone who would give a new graduate with no experience a chance.





After almost a year of searching I found that in Choose Chicago. The team there empowered me to grow and work on a mutlitude of projects I am really proud of. I've grown a lot since April of 2013 and will forever be grateful for the chance they gave me, but now its time to move on.





My family is relocating to San Diego, CA and beginnign the next chapter of our lives. I start a new role at Intellisis on Monday. 





But today I am reflecting. I am thankful.





Most importantly, I'm excited for what the future holds.





Onward!
