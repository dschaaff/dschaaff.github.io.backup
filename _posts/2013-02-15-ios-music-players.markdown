Pro tip.




On the desktop we’re mostly limited to using iTunes for music playback (aside from streaming services). If you don’t like iTunes, good luck finding a better alternative.




Thankfully the situation is different on an iOS device. Don’t like apple’s music app? Simply fire up the AppStore and download a 3rd party music player. I recommend checking out [Ecoute](http://ecouteapp.com/ecouteios/), [Track 8](http://enderlabs.com/track-8) , [Groove 2](http://www.zikeragroove.com/).
