 I just started using Evernote a few days ago and its already one of my favorite pieces of software. (I know I'm a little late the party, its nothing new).  The desktop app is great, but my favorite part so far is the iOS app.  A thought hit me today and I was able to quickly jot it down on my phone.  When I got home it was there waiting in the desktop app thanks to Evernote's seamless syncing.  I like this already…
