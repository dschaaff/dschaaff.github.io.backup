I’ve been using declarative pipelines in Jenkins for a while with the Slack [plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin) to send build notifications to Slack. The plugin does what it says on the tin but gives you a pretty boring message by default.

I used the environment variables available in the pipeline to make things a little bit better and link back to the job.

But I was still always disappointed the notifications didn’t contain more information. Thankfully version 2.3 of the [plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin) added support for the attachments portion of the [Slack message API](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-formatting). I was able to leverage the attachments feature to get better message formatting. Meanwhile, I took some inspiration from [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39920437/how-to-access-junit-test-counts-in-jenkins-pipeline-project) to incorporate test result summaries.

I store this in a shared pipeline library to avoid repeating the code in every Jenkinsfile. This way you can simply call it in a post step like this.

```groovy
post {
  always {
    notifySlack currentBuild.result
  }
}
```

Here is the code in the pipeline library

The end result is a much more informative message.
