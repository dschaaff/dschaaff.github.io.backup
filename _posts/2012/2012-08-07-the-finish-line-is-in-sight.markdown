The last 4 weeks have been a blur.  I took on extra course in order to finish school at the end of this month.  And by finish, I mean graduate!!  My brain is tired all the time, and I've been working overtime on school, but its the first time I can feel the end being near.  





September=freedom.  And hopefully a job.
