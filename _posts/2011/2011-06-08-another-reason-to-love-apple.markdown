 One of the biggest criticism I usually hear about Apple products are that they are too expensive.  Never mind that these criticisms don't understand total cost of ownership.  When OSX Lion is released in July it will only cost users $30.  There are two versions.  If you want OSX server you are only forking over $50 for a license.  Compare that to the cost of buying a Windows 7 box.  Not to mention that Microsoft releases several versions with different levels of features for different price points.  With Apple its simple.  Server, or regular version, and all features are included.
