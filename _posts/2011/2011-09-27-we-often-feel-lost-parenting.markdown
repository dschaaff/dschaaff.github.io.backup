or at least I do.  Raising a child is intimidating and I constantly question if I'm doing things right.  Its for precisely this reason that <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/">Babycenter<a/> is such a life saver.  We subscribed to their email updates while Tif was pregnant with Mylin.  Each week we got an email describing our child's development.  Those emails now come weekly for our toddler.  Each update seems to contain at least one insight or reminder that helps navigate my interactions with Mylin.  If you have children I highly recommend using the site.  They also have an iOS app if you prefer that too email updates.
