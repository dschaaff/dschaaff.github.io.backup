For a long time I used Echofon as my main twitter app.  It was ugly as sin but it would sync my unread status between my iPhone and my mac.  Eventually I fell in love with Tweetbot too much to keep using Echofon.  I always missed the syncing though and I usually avoided using Twitter on my mac because I hated having to scroll to find where I left off, not to mention it telling me all of my direct messages were unread.  Thankfully a developer named Manton Reece created the [Tweetmarker](http://tweetmarker.net/) service.  This is an open service that can be implemented by any Twitter app and will sync your timeline position between multiple apps.  Now, when I open Twitterific on my mac it automatically scrolls the last tweet I read in Tweetbot on my iPhone.  Simply put, I love it!
