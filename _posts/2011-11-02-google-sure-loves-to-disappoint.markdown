Sure enough Gmail is live in the app store.  Unfortunately its not an entirely native application.  Most of it is a native wrapper for a web view of the mobile site.  We get push notifications(except that their broken right now), address book integration, and the ability to attach photos, but the interface is a bit laggy and still won't format an html email to fit the screen.




I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  Google usually releases products publicly before they're ready and then slowly improves them.  Link to the app store below.
