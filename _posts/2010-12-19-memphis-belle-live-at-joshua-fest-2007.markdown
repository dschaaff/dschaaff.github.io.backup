I found a dvd I had lost of Memphis Belle playing at Joshua Fest in 2007.  It brought back a lot great memories.  Rock n Roll is a blast and never disappoints.  We may have spent many a night sleeping in Stella (our un-airconditioned van) in Wal-Mart parking lots, but we went out and took risks in pursuit of our dreams.  Sure there are always things that could have been done differently, but I will always remember this as one of the best times of my life.  It's too bad we all live spread out across the country now.  I miss you boys.
