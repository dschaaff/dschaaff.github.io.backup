Tif and I have had a lot of conversations about whether we would change the past.  I always would say that are things I would absolutely like to change.  That's where I naturally go with regret.  Tif didn't think you could divorce what has happened in the past with who we are today and in a lot of ways I've come to agree with her.  Good or bad, where we are is a direct result of where we've been.  I had to learn to not dwell on things that had happened, but instead focus on where I was and where I was heading.
